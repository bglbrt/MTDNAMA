# Estimation of mitochondrial DNA copy number from high-throughput microarray data

The amount of mitochondrial DNA in a cell has recently been identified as a key biomarker for cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. However, providing accurate, robust and cheap measures of the amount of mitochondrial DNA contained in still a research subject, with numerous options having been put forward in the recent literature.

This repository contains an internship [report](https://github.com/bglbrt/MTDNAMA/blob/main/report.pdf) which explores a novel approach that aims at estimating mtDNA copy numbers from high-throughput DNA microarray data.
